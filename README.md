CSE 217 - Introduction to Data Science HW11
" For our final project this semester, we'll take a look at data for Melbourne Housing Price Prediction
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/melbourne-housing-snapshot.

As you have seen throughout the semseter we have learned various techniques to solve a problem task (Classification, Regression, Clustering etc.) 
starting from problem formulation to EDA to model building to model evaluation and performing feaure engineering and selection in order to improve the model's performance.
You will be combining all the knowledge learned so far in this final project. You will be making assuptions and decisions on your own with appropriate justifications in 
writeups about how to improve the prediction model using all the tools and techniques learned so far and provide the best model at the end.

The project aims at building a model of housing prices to predict median house values in Melbourne using the provided dataset. This model should learn from the data and be
able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.

Our goal will be to use this dataset to gain some insight about characteristics of different features.
We will be using data profiling from pandas and create models (hopefully more than 3) and compare them to find out which model performed the best and probably explain
why it is the best model among all in this data. "
